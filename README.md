# Text2Binary

**Text2Binary** is a simple yet powerful tool designed to convert text strings into their binary representations. This project is ideal for educational purposes, developers needing a quick binary conversion tool, or anyone interested in understanding how text data is represented in binary form.

## Features

### Uncompleted Features
1. **Character to Binary Conversion**
   - Converts any text string into its binary representation using ASCII encoding.
   - Supports uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. **Batch Conversion**
   - Allows multiple strings to be converted at once, outputting the binary for each string sequentially.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - A user-friendly interface built with Python's Tkinter for desktop applications or a web-based interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
   - Provides a clear input area for text and a display area for the binary output.

4. **Educational Mode**
   - Offers a step-by-step explanation of how each character in the input string is converted into its binary representation.
   - Interactive mode where users can see the conversion process in real-time.

5. **Export Functionality**
   - Allows users to export the binary output to a text file for storage or further use.
   - Option to copy the binary code directly to the clipboard.

### Features Under Development
1. **Binary to Text Conversion**
   - A reverse conversion feature that takes binary code and converts it back to human-readable text.
   - Will support different encoding schemes beyond ASCII, such as Unicode.

2. **Custom Encoding Schemes**
   - Extend support to various encoding schemes like UTF-8 and UTF-16, allowing for more complex text representations.
   - Users will be able to choose the encoding scheme that best suits their needs.

3. **Web API Integration**
   - Develop a RESTful API to allow other applications to use the Text2Binary conversion service programmatically.
   - The API will handle requests for both text-to-binary and binary-to-text conversions.

4. **Extended Export Options**
   - Add functionality to export the binary output in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
   - Integration with cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox for saving the output files.
